# Proxmox-Client-Dashboard
A dashboard site for clients on your proxmox server

When you have multiple servers that you run for multiple people you might want them to have control over their vm or container.
This dashboard aims to give users control to only their VM or container so that you don't have to worry about a user messing up settings or interfering with other VM's and or containers.
